# 👋 Hey there, I'm Dale

I’ve been writing software for over **17 years**, with **13 years of professional experience**. I’ve spent most of my career designing and building reliable systems for payments and inventory management. I take pride in creating architectures that evolve gracefully as businesses grow, and in helping teams write better software together.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually deeply immersed in a book about software, listening to a tech podcast, scouring the web for new approaches to system design, or sketching out ideas to make teams more efficient. Software isn’t just my job—it’s my craft, and I take pride in every stage of the process.

## 🧠 About Me

I specialize in **architecting reliable, maintainable applications that scale with business needs**. I put a strong emphasis on clean boundaries, thoughtful abstractions, and understandable tests. Over the years I’ve led and mentored teams, influenced product direction, run demos for stakeholders, and helped shape technical culture by example.

Things I particularly enjoy:
- Refactoring large, gnarly codebases into elegant, composable systems
- Performing in-depth code reviews and elevating team standards
- Balancing business goals with technical sustainability
- Mentoring engineers and knowledge-sharing across teams
- Architecting modular monoliths and microservices

## 🌱 Personal Growth

### 🔍 Research
Lately, I’ve been exploring how **AI can help engineers write better software**—not as a replacement for developers, but as an intelligent assistant that enhances code quality and architectural decision-making.

### 🧩 Development
My ongoing personal project is an **annotation processor that generates realistic data for testing and early integration**. It was created to address frustrations that I had with both mobile and backend development.

## 💬 Philosophy

I believe in standing on the shoulders of giants while also reaching back to help others up. For me, great software is built where **technical clarity meets business purpose**, and where engineers learn and grow together toward a shared vision.
